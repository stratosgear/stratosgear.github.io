      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well the time to move on has finally come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being a faithfull Ubuntu user since Warty Warthog, Ubuntu 4.10 back in 2004, (wow, already a decade ago) it is time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple online posts complaining about the direction Ubuntu has taken over the last years, but I&amp;rsquo;ll just quickly state my own reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tired of constantly upgrading the system every six months. Although considerable effort is being taken to provide smooth upgrades, usually the procedure to upgrade a system takes a better part of a day.  That is, if everything goes well.  After almost 20 upgrades I had some gone awry on me, which really adds to the burden of updating the system.  And that&amp;rsquo;s only for one system.  Multiply that be 5-6 for all my servers, desktops, laptops, and the amount of work really adds up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the move to Unity (which I don;t like at all) I have been using Gnome3.  The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
